# Instructions  

Based on the PSI API, create a simple HTML document that tells the PSI level

Extract PSI table through [Gov PSI](https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/psi) 

__Sample image data__ in psi-tablesample.png

**Note** Make use of JS dates and format the date and time appropriately. This helps in querying the data from Data.Gov

There's **NO MORE** 3hr data. Just use the 24hr data or other data in the dataset (Thank you for working hard..ðŸ™Œ )

**Bonus Challenge:** Allow user to change or select a date to display the PSI info

**Bonus Challenge:** Try displaying a cross regional(North, South, East, West, Central) or comparing the PSI levels.
