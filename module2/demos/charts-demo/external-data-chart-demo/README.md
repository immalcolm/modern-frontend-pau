1. Load Apex library? OK?
2. what kind of external data? how are we going to load in? use axios
3. ensure both library files are placed infront of own script
4. start creating our div for our chart
5. lets create a basic chart first
6. use axios to access the data.json 
7. Create a button to access another set of data
8. Button needs a listener? What's the element to target?


Be careful of using async/await and how data is retrieved
